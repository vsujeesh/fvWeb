Anyone using the fvWeb project is reponsible for the security of their own instance. I will announce critical fixes on our discord server, but it is your duty to keep your instance up to date and secure.

There is no guarantee that the project will be kept updated at any point in time. If your infrastructure depends on fvWeb, I recommend you create a fork and keep the application secure your self.

Please keep in mind that I am a hobbist programmer, and thus I do not and cannot pay as much attention and detail to security.

## Reporting Vulnarbilities

Please do not report any critical vulnarbilities through github issues. Instead, email me using the address provided in the README file.

For less severe security issues, consider whether they are harmless enough before reporting using github.
